				<h2>Baja SAE India</h2>
			<div id="category_details">
				<p>Baja SAE is a single seated all-terrain vehicle design and fabrication
				competition for students organized by SAE (Society of Automotive Engineers)
				India an affiliate to SAE International. Each team's goal is to design and build
				a prototype of a rugged single seat, off-road recreational four-wheel
				vehicle. The Baja SAE series consists of seven competitions held across the
				globe. Students must function as a team not only to design, build, test,
				promote, and run a vehicle within the limits of the rules, but also to manage
				their educational priorities and at the same time generate financial support for
				their project.</p>
				<p>We participated in Baja SAE 2010 and 2012, both held in Pithampur near Indore
				in the NATRAX facility. Gasotech was our title sponsor in both attempts and we
				extend our heartfelt gratitude to Mr Prakash Shetty, our alumni and Managing
				Director of Gasotech India Ltd.</p>

		<h3>Unwind 1.0</h3>

			<p>Our decision to take part in Baja SAE 2010 required radical changes in the
			approach of the student community towards projects. The college provided us with
			a workspace and work began in the summer of 2009. Everything was new to the team
			members and so everything was built from scratch. The Gasotech Unwind 1.0 was
			special because a gearbox was built by the students, a CVT was incorporated in
			the transmission and the chassis was made of chromoly. This made the car stand
			out from the others and was one of the lightest cars in the event. It was also
			the 8th best in terms of design.</p>

			<p>Our second foray into the Baja SAE event was in 2012. The team was able to
				get the car up and running three months in advance to the competition, allowing
				ample time to run tests and tune the vehicle. It comes as no surprise then that
				we were able to do so well. We were called the "Leopards of Kerala" by the other
				teams considering our hill climbing ability and quick acceleration.</p>
			<h4>Achievements:</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>16th overall out of 250 teams</li>
				<li>Dronacharya award - best faculty in charge award</li>
