				<h2>SAE AERO DESIGN EAST</h2>
			<div id="category_details">
				<p>The SAE Aero Design East is an international competition intended to provide
				undergraduate and graduate engineering students with a real-life engineering
				challenge. The competition has been designed to provide exposure to the kinds of
				situations that engineers face in their real-life work environment. The students
				have to come up with a Remote controlled aircraft design solution that will
				optimally meet the mission requirements while still conforming to the
				configuration limitations and fabricate the same.</p>

				<p>The competition aims to inspire and develop enterprising and innovative young
				engineers from around the world. It gives students an opportunity to learn new
				skills and showcase their talent. In addition to technical skills the team
				acquires management, marketing and people skills, valid across all sectors of
				employment.</p>

		<h3>Design Objective</h3>
		<div id="category1" class="category">
			
				
				
			<p>The objective of Regular Class is to design an aircraft that can lift as much
			weight as possible while observing the available power and aircraft’s length,
			width, and height requirements. Accurately predicting the lifting capacity of
			the aircraft is an important part of the exercise, as prediction bonus points
			often determine the difference in placement between competing teams.</p>

			<p>The Regular Class will be divided into 3 phases as follows:</p><br/>

			<h4>Phase 1: Technical report</h4><br/>

			<p>Teams will electronically submit their proposals for competition detailing
			how their design has met or exceeded the design requirements.</p>


			<h4>Phase 2: Technical Presentation and Inspection </h4><br/>


			<h5>Phase 2A</h5>
			<p> Payload Loading Demonstration (timed event during Oral Presentation).</p>


			<h5>Phase 2B</h5>
			<p> Payload Unloading Demonstration (timed event during Oral Presentation) </p>


			<h5>Phase C – Oral Presentation</h5>

			<br/><br/>
			<h4>Phase 3: Flight Competition</h4>
